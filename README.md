You know, a rundown. For Hangouts. What part didn't you get?


Things I Learned While Writing This
===================================

- AngularJS
- Google Hangouts API
- Jasmine
- Angular in NodeJS/ExpressJS
- Dev/Staging/Production Flow with Heroku

TODO
====
- Get some actual graphics.
- Set up an "about" page.
- Enable pausing?
- Potentially change the room topic when changing to a new rundown topic?
- Enable conversation moderator (admin).
- Have a separate view for when the application hasn't loaded yet.
- BONUS: Enable pre-creation of topic lists for future conversations.
- Implement On Air functions (https://developers.google.com/+/hangouts/api/gapi.hangout.onair)
