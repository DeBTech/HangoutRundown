- Potentially change the room topic when changing to a new rundown topic?
- Enable conversation moderator (admin).
- Have a separate view for when the application hasn't loaded yet.
- BONUS: Enable pre-creation of topic lists for future conversations.
- Implement On Air functions (https://developers.google.com/+/hangouts/api/gapi.hangout.onair)
